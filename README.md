# Typing Speed Test App

Welcome to the **Typing Speed Test** app! This is a fun and interactive tool to measure your typing speed and accuracy. Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), the app uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling. Creating this project helped me deepen my understanding of Redux and refine my frontend development skills.

## Features

-   **Typing Speed Test:** Challenge yourself to see how many words you can type per minute, with live updates as you type.
-   **Error Detection:** Keeps track of mistakes so you know where to improve.
-   **Random Text Generator:** Each test gives you a new set of words to keep things fresh.
-   **Redux State Management:** Efficiently handles app state for a seamless experience.
-   **Custom Styles:** Designed with responsive, modern styles using Sass.

## Technologies Used

-   **React** - For building the user interface.
-   **Redux** - For managing application state.
-   **Sass** - For styling the app.

## What I Learned

-   **Redux Basics:** Gained hands-on experience with actions, reducers, and the store to manage state efficiently.
-   **Sass for Styling:** Used Sass features like variables and nesting to create clean, maintainable styles.
-   **React Components:** Improved at breaking down a UI into small, reusable components.

## TODO

-   [ ] Make a pause system to allow users to take breaks.
-   [ ] Generate random words dynamically to make each test unique.
-   [ ] Allow users to customize visuals with a settings menu.
